- **AI as a thought partner, not a replacement**
Effective pair programming with AI follows a collaborative cycle where both you and the AI contribute meaningfully to the solution. The goal is to enhance your understanding and skills, not replace them.
  - Knowledge Transfer: Always ask the AI to explain why its solution works. Understanding the reasoning is more valuable than the code itself.
  - Active Learning: Type out code yourself rather than copying/pasting. This reinforces learning and gives you time to process each line.
  - Iteration: Use multiple exchanges to refine solutions. Good pair programming is a conversation, not a one-time request.
  - Frame questions to invite collaboration rather than solutions
  - Ask for explanations of generated code rather than just implementations
  - Use AI to explore multiple approaches and understand tradeoffs
  - Maintain critical thinking by suggesting your own solutions first
  - Challenge AI-generated code by asking about edge cases and limitations

- **Self-Reflection Questions**
  - After using AI assistance, can I explain this code to someone else without referring back to it?
  - Did I understand why certain decisions were made in the implementation?
  - Could I modify this code for slightly different requirements without AI help?
  - What specific new concept or technique did I learn from this interaction?

## Lesson Activities

### Activity 1: AI Tool Exploration (45 minutes)
Participants will explore different AI coding assistants and compare their capabilities.

**Steps:**
1. Sign up for free accounts on ChatGPT, Gemini, and explore GitHub Copilot (if available)
2. Ask each tool to solve the same coding problem (e.g., "Create a function that checks if a string is a palindrome")
3. Compare the responses and note differences in code style, explanations, and accuracy
4. Share findings with the group

### Activity 2: Pair Programming with AI (60 minutes)
Participants will practice using AI tools as a pair programming partner to build a simple web application.

**Steps:**
1. Choose a simple project (e.g., a to-do list app)
2. Use an AI assistant to help plan the application architecture
3. Generate initial code with AI guidance
4. Refine and customize the code
5. Document the experience and lessons learned

### Activity 3: Ethical Considerations Individual Reflection (20 minutes)
Participants will individually reflect on ethical considerations when using AI tools in their learning and future careers.

**Steps:**
1. Participants read through the following prompting questions:
    - How might using AI tools affect your learning process? What skills might you develop more slowly or miss entirely?
    - When would you disclose your use of AI tools to others (employers, clients, collaborators)?
    - How can you ensure you understand code that was partially or fully generated by AI?
    - What types of projects or tasks would you avoid using AI assistance for, and why?
    - How might AI tools perpetuate biases in code, and how can you mitigate this?
    - What boundaries would you set for yourself regarding AI tool usage?

2. Write a personal reflection addressing at least three of these questions
3. Identify personal guidelines for ethical AI tool usage in learning and professional contexts

### Activity 4: Ethical Considerations Mentor Discussion (30 minutes)
Participants will engage in guided discussions with mentors about ethical AI usage scenarios.

**Discussion Scenarios:**
1. **Learning Context**: A bootcamp student uses AI to complete most of their assignments but struggles in technical interviews.
  - Prompts: What are the consequences? How could they have used AI more effectively? What responsibility do educators have?

2. **Workplace Scenario**: You're asked to build a feature quickly, and you use AI to generate most of the code without fully understanding it.
  - Prompts: What risks does this create? How would you communicate this to your team? What follow-up actions should you take?

3. **Intellectual Property**: You use AI to generate code for a client project, and the AI incorporates code similar to another open-source project.
  - Prompts: What are the legal and ethical implications? How could you have prevented this? How would you address it?

4. **Team Dynamics**: Your team has varying comfort levels with AI tools, from enthusiastic adoption to strong resistance.
  - Prompts: How do you navigate these differences? What policies might help? How do you respect different perspectives?

5. **Skill Development**: You notice you're becoming dependent on AI for certain types of problems.
  - Prompts: How do you recognize this dependency? What strategies could help maintain your skills? How do you balance efficiency with skill development?

### Activity 5: Building a RAG-based Application (90 minutes)
Participants will create a simple RAG-based application that can answer questions about a specific codebase.

**Steps:**
1. Clone the example repository: [LlamaIndex RAG Starter](https://github.com/run-llama/llama_index/tree/main/examples/starter)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/run-llama/llama_index.git
cd llama_index/examples/starter
```

2. Install the required dependencies:

```shellscript
pip install llama-index pypdf
```


3. Set up your OpenAI API key (or alternative model provider):

```shellscript
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```


4. Modify the example code to index a codebase instead of PDFs:

```python
import os
from llama_index.core import VectorStoreIndex, SimpleDirectoryReader

# Load code files from a directory
documents = SimpleDirectoryReader(
    input_dir="./path_to_your_codebase",
    file_extns=[".py", ".js", ".ts", ".html", ".css", ".md"]
).load_data()

# Create index from the loaded files
index = VectorStoreIndex.from_documents(documents)

# Save the index for later use
index.storage_context.persist("./code_index")

# Create a query engine
query_engine = index.as_query_engine()

# Example queries
response = query_engine.query("How is authentication handled in this codebase?")
print(response)

response = query_engine.query("Explain the database schema used in this project")
print(response)
```


5. Create a simple web interface using Streamlit:

```python
import streamlit as st
from llama_index.core import StorageContext, load_index_from_storage

# Load the previously created index
storage_context = StorageContext.from_defaults(persist_dir="./code_index")
index = load_index_from_storage(storage_context)
query_engine = index.as_query_engine()

st.title("Code Assistant")
st.write("Ask questions about the codebase")

query = st.text_input("Your question:")
if query:
    response = query_engine.query(query)
    st.write("Answer:")
    st.write(response.response)
```


6. Run the Streamlit app:

```shellscript
streamlit run app.py
```

7. Test with various questions about the code structure and functionality


### Activity 6: AI Tool Evaluation (45 minutes)
Participants will develop criteria for evaluating which AI tools best fit different development scenarios.

**Misconception: AI tools will replace the need to learn coding fundamentals.**
- Reality: AI tools augment your skills but require strong fundamentals to use effectively and evaluate generated code.

**Misconception: AI-generated code is always correct and optimal.**
- Reality: AI can produce bugs, inefficient code, or outdated approaches that require human review and testing.

**Misconception: Using AI tools in learning is cheating.**
- Reality: When used properly, AI tools can enhance learning by providing explanations and alternative approaches, but should be used thoughtfully.

**Misconception: All AI tools have the same capabilities.**
- Reality: Different tools have varying strengths, weaknesses, and specializations that make them suitable for different tasks.

**Misconception: AI tools understand context perfectly.**
- Reality: AI tools often miss important context and require clear, specific prompts with sufficient background information.

**Misconception: Open source models are always inferior to closed source ones.**
- Reality: Open source models can be highly effective for specific tasks and offer advantages in customization, privacy, and cost.

**Misconception: More parameters always means better code generation.**
- Reality: Specialized smaller models may outperform larger general models for specific programming tasks.

**Misconception: AI tools eliminate the need for code review.**
- Reality: AI-generated code requires even more careful review as it may contain subtle issues or misunderstandings.

**Misconception: Using AI tools will make me less valuable as a developer.**
- Reality: Skilled use of AI tools is becoming an expected competency that can make you more productive and valuable.
