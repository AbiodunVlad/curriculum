## What are Machine Learning and LLMs?

### Machine Learning (ML)

Machine Learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on building systems that can learn from and make decisions based on data. Instead of explicitly programming rules, ML systems identify patterns in data and use those patterns to make predictions or decisions.

Key concepts:
- **Supervised Learning**: Training with labeled data
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Finding patterns in unlabeled data
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Learning through trial and error with rewards
- **Neural Networks**: Computational models inspired by the human brain

### Large Language Models (LLMs)

LLMs are a specific type of ML model designed to understand and generate human language. They're trained on vast amounts of text data and can perform a wide range of language tasks.

Key characteristics:
- Trained on billions or trillions of words
- Can generate coherent and contextually relevant text
- Understand and respond to natural language queries
- Can perform tasks like translation, summarization, and content creation

Examples include GPT-4, Claude, Llama, and Gemini.

### Comparing ML and LLMs
