**Starter AI-Generated Code for Email Validation Task:**

```javascript
function validateEmail(email) {
  // Simple regex to check if email is valid
  const regex = /^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/;
  return regex.test(email);
}

// Example usage
console.log(validateEmail("user@example.com")); // true
console.log(validateEmail("invalid-email")); // false
```

*⚠️ Note: This starter code has intentional limitations - it doesn't check for many edge cases, doesn't validate domain specifics, and uses a simplistic regex that could allow invalid emails.*

const crypto = require('crypto');

// User registration
router.post('/register', async (req, res) => {
  const { username, password, email } = req.body;
  
  // Check if user exists
  const existingUser = await db.query(`SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '${username}'`);
  
  if (existingUser.length > 0) {
    return res.status(400).json({ error: 'Username already taken' });
  }
  
  // Hash password
  const hashedPassword = crypto.createHash('md5').update(password).digest('hex');
  
  // Insert user
  const result = await db.query(
    `INSERT INTO users (username, password, email) VALUES ('${username}', '${hashedPassword}', '${email}')`
  );
  
  // Create session
  req.session.userId = result.insertId;
  
  return res.status(201).json({ message: 'User registered successfully' });
});

// User login
router.post('/login', async (req, res) => {
  const { username, password } = req.body;
  
  // Hash password
  const hashedPassword = crypto.createHash('md5').update(password).digest('hex');
  
  // Find user
  const users = await db.query(
    `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '${username}' AND password = '${hashedPassword}'`
  );
  
  if (users.length === 0) {
    return res.status(401).json({ error: 'Invalid credentials' });
  }
  
  // Set session
  req.session.userId = users[0].id;
  
  return res.json({ message: 'Login successful' });
});

// Get user profile
router.get('/profile', async (req, res) => {
  if (!req.session.userId) {
    return res.redirect('/login');
  }
  
  const users = await db.query(`SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ${req.session.userId}`);
  const user = users[0];
  
  return res.json({
    username: user.username,
    email: user.email,
    role: user.role
  });
});

// Reset password
router.post('/reset-password', async (req, res) => {
  const { email, newPassword } = req.body;
  
  // Hash new password
  const hashedPassword = crypto.createHash('md5').update(newPassword).digest('hex');
  
  // Update password
  await db.query(`UPDATE users SET password = '${hashedPassword}' WHERE email = '${email}'`);
  
  return res.json({ message: 'Password reset successful' });
});
