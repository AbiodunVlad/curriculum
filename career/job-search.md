#### 5. **Tailor Your Resume and Cover Letter**:
   Each time you apply for a job, ensure that your resume and cover letter are customized for the position. Match the language of the job description and highlight relevant skills and experiences. 

#### 6. **Track Your Applications**:
   Keep track of where you've applied, the status of your applications, and any follow-up actions needed. Tools like **Trello**, **Notion**, or **Airtable** can help you organize your job search.
   - **Application Tracker**: Use a spreadsheet to track the roles you’ve applied to, their deadlines, interview dates, and feedback received.

#### 7. **Prepare for Interviews**:
   Research the company and role, practice common interview questions, and develop a list of questions to ask your interviewers. This shows that you are proactive and interested in the company.
   - Use platforms like **LeetCode** or **HackerRank** for coding practice.
   - Use behavioral interview guides (e.g., STAR method) to structure your responses.
