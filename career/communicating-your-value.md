## Communicating your Value

**Documentation**

Making a personal note of your achievements can save you time and work later down the line when you’ve got to “show receipts” as evidence when pushing for a role in a big project, a promotion, a raise, etc. You should be able to take a moment and document its value for later reference.

- ✨ Moment: Successfully completed day to day work
- ✏️ Documentation: upon assignment, upon completion, follow up about impact for results / numbers
- ✨ Moment: your project or individual/team recognitions
- ✏️ Documentation: slide deck or statement from leadership and impact
- ✨ Moment: Personal awards, publications, or references to you
- ✏️ Documentation: what makes this reference or award reputable or significant and what was your impact that led to the reference?
- ✨ Moment: Demoing at your company, externally within groups, or on external platforms such as sharing learnings/projects/progress on socials
- ✏️ Documentation: Why was your demo relevant and what was its impact? Were you exposing a population to new ideas?

It is also valuable to translate meaningful interactions, especially if you are consistently commended for doing so!

- Helping onboard people,
- Working cross functionally,
- Providing context to colleagues and/or other stakeholders
- Advocating for your individual or team decisions or projects to stakeholders or other teams,

O- ptimizing processes,

- Setting the standard in best practices,
- Ex: Consistently enhancing documentation
- Ex: PR description details or personal PR templates makes it easy for colleagues to know whats happening in your work
- Ex: complete ticket descriptions inform stakeholders of business need, problem you will be solving, historical context or reference to related work(s), consistent updates of solution status; making it easy for them to track the work status and have knowledge about what its doing
- Slack thank yous

So where should you be saving these things? In a personal location! Consider if you were to leave your company tomorrow. You would still want access to your achievements, peer reviews, 1:1 notes even when you are no longer connected to the company. Any details that tell the story of your growth, challenges, learnings, achievements, and impact that you might want to recall in the future are what you should be saving! Also consider, do you want these things accessible to others, are there collaborative docs? What sort of privacy settings do you want, even for documents that you keep company-internal.

## Recommendations / Feedback

Companies typically have rounds of reviews received from peers, senior colleagues, and leadership. These reviews can offer examples of your highlighted impact or share ways that you can implement learning opportunities from areas of needed improvement. Also take this feedback and document it! Follow up with people for clear examples if needed. Get creative and invite ongoing feedback from others by creating an anonymous survey link where peers can leave anonymous feedback. When you strike up relationships with someone, invite them to leave external recommendations such as on LinkedIn or ask for feedback following an event, talk, etc. This can all translate into moments of note that you can reference back to -or- lead to opportunities of growth!
