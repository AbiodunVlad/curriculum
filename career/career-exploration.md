## Activities

### üßòüèæ Activity 1: Career Orientation Self-Assessment

Understanding your current career orientation helps identify appropriate next steps in your journey to becoming a full stack software engineer.

1. Assess your current level of career awareness (Do you know where you want to go?)
2. Evaluate your current level of career satisfaction (Are you happy with your current situation?)
3. Identify which quadrant best describes your current state
4. Review the recommended next steps for your quadrant
5. Use this insight to inform your career exploration activities

#### How to Apply This to Your Career Transition

Your current career orientation isn't fixed‚Äîit's a snapshot of where you are right now. As you develop new skills, gain clarity about your goals, and take steps toward your desired career, your orientation will shift.

For career changers moving into full stack software engineering, this framework helps you:

- Acknowledge your starting point without judgment
- Identify whether you need to focus on building awareness, satisfaction, or both
- Choose appropriate next steps based on your current orientation
- Track your progress as you move through different quadrants
  Remember that many successful software engineers started in the "Disoriented" or "Shifting" quadrants. With intentional exploration and skill development, you can move toward a "Purposeful" orientation in your new career.

### üìä Activity 2: Skills Matrix Mapping

2. **Misconception**: Changing careers means starting completely from scratch. \
   **Reality**: Many skills are transferable, and your unique background can be a competitive advantage in tech.
3. **Misconception**: You need a computer science degree to become a full stack developer. \
   **Reality**: Many successful developers are self-taught or come from bootcamps and non-traditional backgrounds.
4. **Misconception**: You must be naturally gifted at math or logic to succeed in programming. \
   **Reality**: Programming skills can be developed through practice and persistence.
5. **Misconception**: Career exploration is a one-time event. \
   **Reality**: Career development is an ongoing process that evolves throughout your professional life.
6. **Misconception**: You should choose a career path based solely on salary potential. \
