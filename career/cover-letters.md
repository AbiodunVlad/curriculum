# Cover Letters

## Exercise

Consider the job announcement(s) for which you created a resume. Write a cover letter for each opportunity.

Cover letters are a means to showcase your interest and capacity to meet an opportunity's requirements and needs. There are various types of opportunities for which you could write a cover letters, including professional roles, volunteer opportunities, speaking engagements, program entrances, or scholarships.

### Key Elements of a Great Cover Letter

1. **Header and Contact Information**:
   At the top of your cover letter, make sure to include your contact information (name, address, phone number, email), followed by the employer's contact information (hiring manager's name, company name, address, etc.). If you're submitting an email, the subject line should be clear and concise, like "Application for Software Engineer Role."
2. **Introduction**:
   The introduction should explain why you are writing. Mention the position you are applying for and where you found the job listing. If you were referred by someone, include their name here.
3. **Body (Why You're a Great Fit)**:
   The body of the cover letter is where you detail why you are a strong candidate for the position. Make sure to:
   - Address the specific skills and experience required for the job.
   - Show how your background aligns with the company's mission or the role itself.
   - Provide examples of past successes or experiences that demonstrate your capability.
   - Show that you've done research on the company and explain why you're excited about the opportunity.
4. **Closing (Call to Action)**:
   Conclude the letter by thanking the employer for their time and consideration. Mention that you're looking forward to the possibility of discussing your qualifications in more detail and that you're available for an interview at their convenience.

   Example: _"I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to [Company Name] as a [Job Title] and look forward to discussing how my background, skills, and enthusiasm can benefit your team."_

5. **Signature**:
   In a formal cover letter, sign off with a professional closing such as "Sincerely," followed by your name.

### Tips for Writing a Successful Cover Letter:

1. **Be Tailored**: Customize each cover letter to the specific job. Avoid using a generic cover letter for every application.
2. **Use Professional Tone**: Even if you're writing to a company with a casual culture, maintain professionalism throughout the letter.
3. **Use Quantifiable Achievements**: Where possible, include metrics to highlight your accomplishments (e.g., "Increased revenue by 20% in the first quarter").
4. **Keep It Concise**: A cover letter should be no longer than one pageâ€”ideally, around 3-4 short paragraphs.

## Communicating with your Manager, Team, & other Stakeholders

Throughout your first role, you will communicate with various people across your team and outside of your team. Itâ€™s important to build relationships and make the most out of those interactions.

**Exercise 1:** Consider your career growth goals. Copy [the following doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PGKcCiOsi3twDzjGf1zrz_-a-ZWwmG3pGz2NsCSN3SM/edit?usp=sharing) and begin to fill out the form according to where youâ€™d like to be in a few years. Remember to write down actionable goals that you can put into practice in your first role!

Are your goals learning oriented? Do you need carved out time in your schedule dedicated to learning?

Are your goals relationship or resource building? Do you need help making connections? Do you need access to and/or recommendations for resources?

In your first role, your manager will be your greatest resource to making your growth goals a reality, but youâ€™ve got to do the work of holding the consistent conversations and holding them accountable. So, how do you have that conversation? Break the ice by learning what they see in you and how they can help you be a better professional ([i.e. 1:1 doc convo topics](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19SBz9VGuAFpi0FbceLmLP-LfLnCTOs279m_pAxLwc8Y/edit?usp=sharing)). Sometimes having these career conversations can take vulnerability that is new, hardly used, and / or uncomfortable. Be mindful of that feeling so that you can challenge yourself to grow that also! You will need to lean into the skill of clearly stating your goals more and more over your career in order to take it by the reins.

Outside of knowing yourself and challenging yourself to self-advocate. Itâ€™s important to understand other people around you and their [working styles](https://asana.com/resources/work-styles) or [communication style](https://www.indeed.com/hire/c/info/workplace-communication-styles). Is their working style new to you? Is their communication style uncomfortable for you? You will need to understand these aspects of working with others in order to challenge yourself to both accommodate others at times, while challenging yourself to grow. Setting the tone for [effective communication](https://asana.com/resources/effective-communication-workplace) is key in a new environment, especially in a professional setting.

**Exercise 2:** Develop a [README](http://bit.ly/daaimah-readme) or [Working with Me](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eCW4sCSB3q5zVK2bHHl-TNUfHijKn8WRoG9cMnoHrVc/edit) guide for others to get some advanced insight into knowing about your work and communication styles.
