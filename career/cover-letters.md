# Cover Letters

## Exercise
Consider the job announcement(s) for which you created a resume. Write a cover letter for each opportunity. 

Cover letters are a means to showcase your interest and capacity to meet an opportunity's requirements and needs. There are various types of opportunities for which you could write a cover letters, including professional roles, volunteer opportunities, speaking engagements, program entrances, or scholarships.

### Key Elements of a Great Cover Letter

1. **Header and Contact Information**: 
   At the top of your cover letter, make sure to include your contact information (name, address, phone number, email), followed by the employer's contact information (hiring manager's name, company name, address, etc.). If you're submitting an email, the subject line should be clear and concise, like "Application for Software Engineer Role."

2. **Introduction**:
   The introduction should explain why you are writing. Mention the position you are applying for and where you found the job listing. If you were referred by someone, include their name here.

3. **Body (Why You're a Great Fit)**:
   The body of the cover letter is where you detail why you are a strong candidate for the position. Make sure to:
   - Address the specific skills and experience required for the job.
   - Show how your background aligns with the company's mission or the role itself.
   - Provide examples of past successes or experiences that demonstrate your capability.
   - Show that you've done research on the company and explain why you're excited about the opportunity.

4. **Closing (Call to Action)**:
   Conclude the letter by thanking the employer for their time and consideration. Mention that you're looking forward to the possibility of discussing your qualifications in more detail and that you're available for an interview at their convenience.

   Example: *"I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to [Company Name] as a [Job Title] and look forward to discussing how my background, skills, and enthusiasm can benefit your team."*

5. **Signature**:
   In a formal cover letter, sign off with a professional closing such as "Sincerely," followed by your name.

### Tips for Writing a Successful Cover Letter:
1. **Be Tailored**: Customize each cover letter to the specific job. Avoid using a generic cover letter for every application.
2. **Use Professional Tone**: Even if you're writing to a company with a casual culture, maintain professionalism throughout the letter.
3. **Use Quantifiable Achievements**: Where possible, include metrics to highlight your accomplishments (e.g., "Increased revenue by 20% in the first quarter").
4. **Keep It Concise**: A cover letter should be no longer than one page‚Äîideally, around 3-4 short paragraphs.

## Communicating with your Manager, Team, & other Stakeholders

Throughout your first role, you will communicate with various people across your team and outside of your team. It‚Äôs important to build relationships and make the most out of those interactions. 


Exercise 1: Consider your career growth goals. Copy [the following doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PGKcCiOsi3twDzjGf1zrz_-a-ZWwmG3pGz2NsCSN3SM/edit?usp=sharing) and begin to fill out the form according to where you‚Äôd like to be in a few years. Remember to write down actionable goals that you can put into practice in your first role!

Are your goals learning oriented? Do you need carved out time in your schedule dedicated to learning?

Are your goals relationship or resource building? Do you need help making connections? Do you need access to and/or recommendations for resources?

In your first role, your manager will be your greatest resource to making your growth goals a reality, but you‚Äôve got to do the work of holding the consistent conversations and holding them accountable. So, how do you have that conversation? Break the ice by learning what they see in you and how they can help you be a better professional ([i.e. 1:1 doc convo topics](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19SBz9VGuAFpi0FbceLmLP-LfLnCTOs279m_pAxLwc8Y/edit?usp=sharing)). Sometimes having these career conversations can take vulnerability that is new, hardly used, and /  or uncomfortable. Be mindful of that feeling so that you can challenge yourself to grow that also! You will need to lean into the skill of clearly stating your goals more and more over your career in order to take it by the reins. 

Outside of knowing yourself and challenging yourself to self-advocate. It‚Äôs important to understand other people around you and their [working styles](https://asana.com/resources/work-styles) or [communication style](https://www.indeed.com/hire/c/info/workplace-communication-styles). Is their working style new to you? Is their communication style uncomfortable for you? You will need to understand these aspects of working with others in order to challenge yourself to both accommodate others at times, while challenging yourself to grow. Setting the tone for [effective communication](https://asana.com/resources/effective-communication-workplace) is key in a new environment, especially in a professional setting.

Exercise 2: Develop a [README](http://bit.ly/daaimah-readme) or [Working with Me](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eCW4sCSB3q5zVK2bHHl-TNUfHijKn8WRoG9cMnoHrVc/edit) guide for others to get some advanced insight into knowing about your work and communication styles.

Communicating your Value

Documentation
Making a personal note of your achievements can save you time and work later down the line when you‚Äôve got to ‚Äúshow receipts‚Äù as evidence when pushing for a role in a big project, a promotion, a raise, etc. You should be able to take a moment and document its value for later reference.

Moment: Successfully completed day to day work
Documentation: upon assignment, upon completion, follow up about impact for results / numbers
Moment: your project or individual/team recognitions
Documentation: slide deck or statement from leadership and impact

Moment: Personal awards, publications, or references to you
Documentation: what makes this reference or award reputable or significant and what was your impact that led to the reference?

Moment: Demoing at your company, externally within groups, or on external platforms such as sharing learnings/projects/progress on socials
Documentation: Why was your demo relevant and what was its impact? Were you exposing a population to new ideas?

It is also valuable to translate meaningful interactions, especially if you are consistently commended for doing so!
Helping onboard people, 
Working cross functionally, 
Providing context to colleagues and/or other stakeholders
Advocating for your individual or team decisions or projects to stakeholders or other teams, 
Optimizing processes, 
Setting the standard in best practices, 
Ex: Consistently enhancing documentation
Ex: PR description details or personal PR templates makes it easy for colleagues to know whats happening in your work
Ex: complete ticket descriptions inform stakeholders of business need, problem you will be solving, historical context or reference to related work(s), consistent updates of solution status; making it easy for them to track the work status and have knowledge about what its doing
 Slack thank yous

So where should you be saving these things? In a personal location! Consider if you were to leave your company tomorrow. You would still want access to your achievements, peer reviews, 1:1 notes even when you are no longer connected to the company. Any details that tell the story of your growth, challenges, learnings, achievements, and impact that you might want to recall in the future are what you should be saving! Also consider, do you want these things accessible to others, are there collaborative docs? What sort of privacy settings do you want, even for documents that you keep company-internal.

Recommendations / Feedback
Companies typically have rounds of reviews received from peers, senior colleagues, and leadership. These reviews can offer examples of your highlighted impact or share ways that you can implement learning opportunities from areas of needed improvement. Also take this feedback and document it! Follow up with people for clear examples if needed. Get creative and invite ongoing feedback from others by creating an anonymous survey link where peers can leave anonymous feedback. When you strike up relationships with someone, invite them to leave external recommendations such as on LinkedIn or ask for feedback following an event, talk, etc. This can all translate into moments of note that you can reference back to -or- lead to opportunities of growth!
