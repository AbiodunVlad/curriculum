### Common Mistakes / Misconceptions

- **"I should connect with as many people as possible."** Quality connections are more valuable than quantity. Focus on building meaningful relationships with relevant professionals.

- **"My LinkedIn profile should be identical to my resume."** LinkedIn offers more space and features to showcase your personality, projects, and thought leadership. It should complement, not duplicate your resume.

- **"I only need to update my LinkedIn when job searching."** Regular activity and updates keep you visible to your network and recruiters, even when you're not actively looking.

- **"I shouldn't mention I'm a career changer."** Your unique background and transition story can differentiate you. Frame your previous experience as valuable perspective you bring to tech.

- **"I need to have a perfect profile before I start connecting."** Start with the basics and improve over time. An evolving profile shows growth and learning.

- **"LinkedIn Premium isn't worth it for beginners."** Consider a free trial during active job searching to access InMail, applicant insights, and salary data.
