# Non-Technical Interviewing

## Projected Time

About 1–1.5 hours

---

## Motivation

Behavioral interview questions and technical experience are a chance to provide the audience with some insight based on your past behavior in certain situations. Consider your most important projects, features, or initiatives and identify the relevant talking points to answer the most common questions. Prepare your responses so you can clearly describe:

- The **Action** you took,
- The **Context** of your actions,
- And the (positive) **Result** or learnings from your actions.

This preparation will help you stay focused and deliver strong answers in interviews.

---

### Objectives

**Participants will be able to:**

- Frame their experience and time at Techtonica for a variety of audiences.
- Answer questions about their work experience and how it applies to future roles.

---

### Specific Things to Learn

- Preparing a personal narrative.
- Structuring answers using the Action – Context – Result format.
- Crafting meaningful questions to ask interviewers.

---

### Materials

- [Personal Narrative Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SkGqJfPYdDvZO1VDzTLxT7Uq_D5WiscvhX5-dYjrvac/edit?usp=sharing)
- [How to Talk About Yourself in an Interview – Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/04/27/how-to-talk-about-yourself-in-an-interview/)

### Lesson – Personal Narrative

Your personal narrative is a prepared 1–2 minute response to the question:  
**“Tell me about yourself.”**

It should answer:  

- Who you are  
- Why you’re relevant to the role  
- How you got to this conversation (e.g., your journey to Techtonica and what you're interested in next)

Use this [guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SkGqJfPYdDvZO1VDzTLxT7Uq_D5WiscvhX5-dYjrvac/edit?usp=sharing) to help craft and refine your narrative. Practice adapting it for networking events, interviews, or conferences.

### Common Mistakes / Misconceptions

- Focusing too much on your own interests instead of the employer’s needs.
- Failing to provide context or results when describing your past work.
- Giving answers that are too long or too vague.

---

### Guided Practice

Use the **Action – Context – Result (ACR)** format to answer:

- Tell me about a time you completed a challenge as a team.
- Tell me about a time you helped a client.
- Tell me about a project or feature you completed.

**Format:**

- **Action** – One-sentence “punchline” answer to the question.
- **Context** – Describe the situation around your action.
- **Result** – Reiterate the outcome and what you achieved or learned.

Prepare 2–3 personal stories and use them to answer different types of questions by adjusting the framing.

### Independent Practice

- Take an hour to think of answers to as many of the following questions as you can. Later on, as you prepare for more interviews, work towards having an answer to all of them ready to go.
- Utilize [Yoodli](https://app.yoodli.ai/practice/interview) to do at least one practice interview with the listed and other questions, and receive tips and feedback on things like how many filler words you used,
