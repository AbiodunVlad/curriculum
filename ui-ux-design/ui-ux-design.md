### Motivation

User Interfaces (UI) and User Experiences (UX) describe the things users see and feel when they interact with a product. Almost all tech companies build products of some kind or another, and it's imperative that their products be well-received and well-loved by their users.

When a product _feels great_ to use, it’s because someone thought carefully about the user's needs. This is where **user stories** come in — they help teams build with empathy by focusing on _what_ users want and _why_.

Introducing user stories now creates a habit of centering the user — which helps participants later plan MVPs, database schemas, and system design in more human-focused ways.

**Companies that focus on UI/UX designs:**

- [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/): Amazon is a prime example of a company that has built its success and ROI upon a focus on customer experience throughout the entire customer journey and that continually measures the user experience.

### Things to Remember

- Interface design is often seen as the "visible things on screen". In fact, it is about the experience, but not just the experience using the app, it's about the whole user experience, including the one outside the app. Designers must immerse themselves into the user's mind and life.

- The iterative aspect of the design process is key. Designer motto: **The first design is never right**. A good designer always refines solutions and explores options.

### Independent Practice

**Activity #1 - Design Improvements**
Pick an app or website whose UI or UX you dislike and spend 10 minutes making a list of things that could be improved.

Focus of the following:

- Am I able to complete the tasks for which the interface is built for?
- Why would I **not** use the app on a daily basis?
- Details matter. How is the copywriting? The app's personality? The visual language? The colors? The information density?
- List other annoyances you might see, hear, or feel

**Activity #2 - Design Successes**
Name something (an app, an object, an experience, a place) that you use regularly and that is truly making your life better. It doesn't have to be an application or software.

Spend 10 minutes writing down your feelings: Why do you use this in particular? Why not another app?

What do you think stands out in terms of the following?:

- Emotional response
- Usefulness
- Usability
- Simplicity
- Sense of community
- Speed

### Pair Practice

#### Activity #3 - Writing User Stories

Work with a partner to practice writing and reviewing user stories.

1. **Choose an App Together**  
   Pick an app or product you both use — or come up with a simple idea together  
   (e.g. a to-do list, recipe app, or pet adoption platform).

2. **Identify a Type of User**  
   Who is the app for? A student? A commuter? A parent? A small business owner?

3. **Write 2–3 User Stories**  
   Use this format:

   > As a **[type of user]**, When I **[do something]**, then **[I can achieve a benefit]**.

   **Examples:**

   - As a new user, when I visit the signup page, and I sign up with Google, then I am taken to the homepage.
   - As a logged in user, when I visit the settings page, I can fill out a form to update my password.

4. **Swap and Review**  
   Read each other’s stories and offer kind, helpful feedback. Ask:

   - Is the user type specific?
   - Is the benefit clear?

5. **Refine Together**  
   Pick one story to revise together, improving clarity and focus.

> **Wrap-Up Prompt:**  
> What did you notice when reading your partner’s stories?  
> What made a story feel strong or unclear?
