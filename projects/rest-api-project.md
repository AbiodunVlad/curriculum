# Project - Building a REST API with Node and Express

### Introduction

A RESTful API is an Application Programming Interface (API) that uses HTTP verbs like GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE to operate data. Also referred to as RESTful web services, RESTful APIs are based on the REpresentational State Transfer (REST) approach, an architectural style that enables developers to manipulate data.

### General guidelines for projects:

- In this project, you are going to build a REST API to `manage books` with Node.js and Express.
- You will use a simple JavaScript array to store data like Books.
- By Friday afternoon (pair programming time) create your new branch in your assignments repo, push your initial commit up to GitHub and your PR ready to go for your partner.

### Basic Requirements

- Create a app to store information about books like ISBN of the book, title, author, published date, publisher and number of pages.
- Add basic CRUD functionality. You will be able to send requests to it to create, read, update and delete Book entities.

### Frequently Asked Questions

- We can add common FAQs here. Open a PR if you have any questions.
