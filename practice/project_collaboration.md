# Project Collaboration with Multiple Contributors

### Week 10 Group Project: Collaborative Project Design and Development

This lesson introduces participants to collaborating with multiple contributors on a shared project, helping them gain experience in team communication, task division, and Git workflow in a real-world setting. Participants will work on the **Animal Sighting Tracker** project concurrently, implementing collaborative skills while managing both projects efficiently.

---

### Objectives

**Participants will be able to:**

- Plan and design a project collaboratively, with specific roles and responsibilities for each team member.
- Use Git and GitHub effectively for multi-contributor workflows.
- Break down and assign tasks with incremental deadlines.
- Integrate daily check-ins to track progress and understand group needs.
- Complete a screen recording of the final collaborative project in the README.

### Prerequisites

- Familiarity with Git and GitHub workflows for multi-contributor projects
- Completion of prior individual projects (weeks 1-8) as foundational practice
- Introductory knowledge of time management techniques (e.g., Kanban, Scrum)

---

### Project Outline

1. **Project Selection and Setup**:
   - Choose an earlier project from weeks 1-8 and start working on the [Animal Sighting Tracker](https://github.com/Techtonica/curriculum/blob/main/projects/mern-pern-project.md).
   - Define specific responsibilities within each group of 2-3 participants for both projects.
   - Set up shared GitHub repositories with established branch naming conventions.
   - Outline project timelines, with incremental deadlines for each assigned part.

2. **Time Management and Project Breakdown**:
   - Revisit the [Time Management slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1VGlfYtWXQ8TEXsq4Bad0k2WZ-mK02hI3UwVXrfuUpPA/edit?usp=sharing) to plan time effectively for both projects.
   - Intentionally break down each project before beginning any coding, ensuring clear division of tasks and realistic deadlines.
   - Assign tasks that can be accomplished incrementally, with deadlines that allow for ongoing progress in both projects.

3. **Daily Group Check-Ins**:
   - Conduct daily check-ins to track progress, address support needs, and adjust plans as required for both projects.
   - Use project management techniques (e.g., Kanban or Scrum) to help manage time, tasks, and progress on both projects simultaneously.

4. **Development and Implementation**:
   - Each participant will create branches for their assigned tasks, implement code, and conduct local testing on both projects.
   - Regularly review and merge branches after peer verification.
   - Keep pull requests focused to simplify code reviews.

5. **Documentation**:
   - Record a screen walkthrough of the final collaborative project and include it in the README.
   - Document project goals, setup instructions, and task breakdowns clearly in each projectâ€™s README.

### Key Points for Success

- **Time Management**: Consistently apply time management strategies to balance the Animal Sighting Tracker and collaborative projects effectively.
- **Clear Communication**: Stay transparent with group members to ensure each person is supported and tasks are on track.
- **Incremental Deadlines**: Assign and prioritize small tasks with clear, staged deadlines for effective progress in both projects.

### Final Deliverables

- Completed collaborative project with code contributions from all team members.
- A README for the collaborative project, including a screen recording and documentation of roles and responsibilities.
- A functional Animal Sighting Tracker project with well-defined task assignments and completed components.
