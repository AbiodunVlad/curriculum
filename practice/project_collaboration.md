# Project Collaboration with Multiple Contributors

### Week 10 Group Project: Collaborative Project Design and Development

This lesson guides participants through collaborating on a project with multiple contributors to build a shared application with a single, cohesive outcome. This experience will help develop essential teamwork, planning, and Git collaboration skills.

---

### Objectives

**Participants will be able to:**

- Plan and design a project collaboratively with assigned roles and responsibilities.
- Utilize Git and GitHub effectively for multi-contributor workflows.
- Break down and assign tasks with incremental deadlines.
- Implement daily check-ins to track project progress and support needs.
- Complete a screen recording of the final project for the README.

### Prerequisites

- Completion of previous individual projects from weeks 1-8
- Understanding of Git and GitHub for version control
- Basic project planning knowledge and familiarity with Kanban/Scrum concepts

### Project Outline

1. **Project Setup and Planning (Day 1)**:
   - Choose an existing project from weeks 1-8 to redesign as a group.
   - Assign each participant specific features or sections to build independently.
   - Set up a shared GitHub repository and agree on branch naming conventions.
   - Decide on a project timeline, with incremental deadlines for each part.

2. **Daily Check-Ins and Collaboration**:
   - Revisit [Time Management slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1VGlfYtWXQ8TEXsq4Bad0k2WZ-mK02hI3UwVXrfuUpPA/edit?usp=sharing) to help structure your week effectively.
   - Conduct daily check-ins within the group to address any roadblocks, reassign tasks if needed, and discuss the dayâ€™s goals.
   - Use project management techniques like Kanban or Scrum to track task progress.

3. **Implementation Phase**:
   - Each participant should create branches for their assigned tasks, build the code, and perform local testing.
   - Regularly review and merge each branch once code is verified by another group member.
   - Aim to keep pull requests small to facilitate manageable reviews.

4. **Documentation**:
   - Record a screen walkthrough of the final project to include in the README.
   - Create a comprehensive README documenting project goals, setup instructions, and individual responsibilities.
