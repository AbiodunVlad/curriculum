# Incremental Breakdown of Functionality in Pseudocode

## Objectives
- Spend 20-30 minutes analyzing a new feature from a screen recording
- Break down logic for prospective functionality of a given problem
- Revisit and analyze a new feature every week

## Key Breakdown Criteria for Each Feature Analyzed
- Identify and document the main functionality end-to-end
- Break down the logic into pseudocode
- Analyze the stages involved in the feature
- Consider questions like:
-    What inputs does the feature take?
-    What procession occurs?
-    What outputs are produced?

## Additional Requirements
- Revisit time management slides weekly
- Intentionally break down work implementing features and share with trio/mentor
- Check in weekly with trio/mentor for accountability and support
