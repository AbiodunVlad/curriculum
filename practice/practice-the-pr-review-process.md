# Practicing the PR Review Process

Last week you, Week 8 
**Please be sure to implement this activity on Monday or Tuesday**

<!-- Type of problem
We want participants to practice reading full stack application source code that isn't their own and having the capacity to articulate how logic is broken down. -->

Practice reading full stack application source code that isn't your own.

## Questions to Consider



## Prerequisites



## Motivation or Real-World Application



## Objectives

## Activity 1

<!-- Have each of the participants get started with the exercise by having them add their name to this file. The PR should include the following:

Title: Pull request title should be concise but descriptive
Description: Contain a description of what the PR is doing
Visual: Labelled before-changes and after-changes screenshots of their work, in the PR description -->

## Activity 2

<!-- Have each participant interactively participate in the PR Review Process by creating a pull request on their feedback partner's full stack code from the previous week (week 7), and reviewing incoming changes to their own work.

Repo Owner:
Task 1. Have participants push up a commit that removed all comments from their full stack application from the previous week.
Task 2. Review (confirm or correct) the incoming changes on the feedback partner's submitted PR; they should be actively leaving comments in response to the incoming PR changes.
Collaborator:
Task 1. Their feedback partner should create a branch that comments what each line of code is doing in the owner's project.
Task 2. Create a pull request for the incoming changes to be reviewed by the project owner.
Activity 3:
Each pull request owner must address their PR feedback in a tangible, but visible way:

You acknowledged the comment (i.e. feedback was marked with an emoji reaction to show its accepted)
You replied to the comment (i.e. feedback was received by adding it to project backlog for review or by furnishing an alternative explanation which you may have originally missed)
You resolved the comment (i.e. feedback was immediately acted upon in PR with your new commit linked in a response to the original comment and the particular conversation marked as "Resolved") -->
