# Developing your brand as a software developer

### Soft Skills for Week 2

- What are your personal values, and how does your personal brand reflect that?
- 3 parts of the soft skills answer:
  - Intro - a super short summary of what you will be talking about - give me the punch line right away
  - Story - only tell details that show what you did!
  - Take away “What I learned from this”, “Going forward I will always”, “The lesson I learned from this situation”...

### Prerequisites

- [GitHub account](https://github.com/)
- [Twitter (or X) account](https://twitter.com)
- [LinkedIn account](https://linkedin.com)

### Motivation

- Your personal brand is your way to distinguish yourself from others and make yourself memorable.
- Having a distinct and relevant personal brand can help employers identify you as a good fit for their open roles, or can help you build credibility with colleagues and managers as you further your career.
- It is worth the investment to think outside the box and develop a brand that will help employers get to know you.

### Lesson

- Choose your lane
  - Pick something you have learned or love and go deep in explanations
  - Join a community
  - Don't be afraid to evolve your niche as you learn and grow. Your brand is dynamic.
- Make Friends
  - Get involved on Twitter (or X) and GitHub
  - Engage in developer communities on platforms like Discord, Slack (e.g., Codenewbie's Slack), or specialized forums.
- Share your experience
  - Blog (on platforms like Medium, dev.to, Hashnode, or your personal site)
  - Tweet (and engage in meaningful conversations on X/Twitter)
  - Speak (at local meetups, online events, or even internal company talks)
  - Contribute to open-source: Fix bugs, improve documentation, or share your own projects.
  - Create and share other forms of content: e.g., code snippets, gists, short video tutorials, or a newsletter.

3. Control your dialogue

- Use Twitter (or X) following, tweeting, blocking.
  - We recommend using [Twitter's reply controls](https://www.socialmediatoday.com/news/twitter-rolls-out-tweet-reply-controls-to-all-users/583327/) to prevent trolls from replying to your tweets.
  - Use [Block Party](https://www.blockpartyapp.com/) to filter out unwanted @mentions from Twitter (or X), and continue to use Twitter (or X) as normal.

### Common Mistakes / Misconceptions

- Most new developers feel they need to be an expert at something before they can share on a topic. The irony is, there are not lots of free beginner content out there for new developer geared towards new developers and the same new developers are in the best position to teach each other today. No matter how new you are, there is someone who knows less than you and you are in the best position to teach them.
- Thinking your brand needs to be perfect from day one. It's an evolution; start small and iterate.
- Underestimating the power of consistency. Sporadic efforts have less impact than regular, even if small, contributions and engagements.

### Guided Practice

- You can add a profile README on your Github when you create a repository with a name that matches your Github username. Take a look at some [examples](https://github.com/abhisheknaiidu/awesome-github-profile-readme) and follow the [tutorials](https://github.com/abhisheknaiidu/awesome-github-profile-readme#tutorials) to set up a profile README.
