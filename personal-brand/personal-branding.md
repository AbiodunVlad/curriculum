## Common Mistakes / Misconceptions
- **"I need to be on every platform"** - Focus on quality engagement on 1-2 platforms rather than spreading yourself thin
- **"I don't have anything valuable to share"** - Even beginners have unique perspectives and learning journeys worth sharing
- **"I need thousands of followers to have a successful brand"** - Quality connections and engagement matter more than follower count
- **"I can't show my personality in a professional context"** - Authenticity helps you stand out; your unique perspective is valuable
- **"Once something is online, it's there forever"** - While true to some extent, you can actively shape your digital presence over time

## Independent Practice
1. Audit your current online presence and clean up any unprofessional content
2. Update your profiles on GitHub and one social platform of your choice
3. Create or update your personal website/portfolio
4. Draft a content calendar with 5-10 post ideas
5. Find and join 3 communities related to your tech interests
