# Deploying to Vercel

## Introduction to Vercel

Vercel is a cloud platform for frontend developers, providing an intuitive workflow for deploying web applications. It's particularly well-suited for Next.js applications (as Vercel created Next.js), but also supports other frameworks like React, Vue, Svelte, and static sites. Vercel focuses on speed, developer experience, and scalability, making it an excellent choice for new developers to get their projects live quickly.

## Prerequisites

- A Vercel account (you can sign up with your GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket account)
- A Git repository (GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket) with your project's code
- Node.js and npm/yarn/pnpm installed locally (for local development)
- Your web application (e.g., a Next.js project, a React SPA, or a static HTML/CSS/JS site)

## Deployment Steps

Vercel integrates directly with your Git repository, providing a seamless continuous deployment (CD) workflow.

### 1. Set up Your Project in a Git Repository

- Ensure your web application is committed and pushed to a GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket repository.
- For Next.js applications, make sure you have a `package.json` with a `build` script (e.g., `"build": "next build"`) and a `start` script (e.g., `"start": "next start"`), as Vercel automatically detects these scripts [^1][^3].

### 2. Connect Vercel to Your Git Provider

- Go to the [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard).
- Click 'Add New...' > 'Project'.
- You'll be prompted to connect your Git account if you haven't already. Choose your provider (GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket) and authorize Vercel.

### 3. Import Your Git Repository

- After connecting, Vercel will show a list of your repositories.
- Select the repository containing the project you want to deploy.
- Click 'Import'.

### 4. Configure Your Project

- Vercel often auto-detects your framework (e.g., Next.js, Create React App).
- **Root Directory:** If your project is in a monorepo or a subdirectory, specify the 'Root Directory' where your `package.json` is located.
- **Build & Output Settings:**
  - Vercel will usually infer the `BUILD COMMAND` (e.g., `npm run build`) and `OUTPUT DIRECTORY` (e.g., `out` for static exports, `.next` for Next.js applications). You can override these if needed.
  - For Next.js projects, Vercel automatically optimizes and deploys them as Node.js servers, supporting all Next.js features [^1][^3].
- **Environment Variables:** If your application uses environment variables, you can add them in the project settings under 'Environment Variables'.
  - Remember that client-side environment variables need to be prefixed with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` [^2].
  - Ensure your sensitive `.env.*` files are in your `.gitignore` [^2].

### 5. Deploy Your Application

- Review all settings and click 'Deploy'.
- Vercel will now clone your repository, install dependencies, run the build command, and deploy your application.
- You'll see a deployment progress page. Once completed, Vercel will provide a unique `.vercel.app` URL where your project is live.

## Key Vercel Features for New Developers

- **Automatic Git Integration:** Every push to your connected branch triggers a new deployment.
- **Instant Previews:** Vercel automatically creates a unique preview URL for every Git push to a non-production branch (e.g., a pull request), making it easy to review changes before merging.
- **Serverless Functions:** Vercel automatically turns API routes and server-side logic in your Next.js app into serverless functions, scaling automatically with demand.
- **Global Edge Network:** Your content is delivered rapidly to users worldwide using Vercel's CDN.
- **Custom Domains:** Easily add your own custom domains and Vercel automatically handles SSL certificates.
- **Built-in Analytics & Speed Insights:** Monitor your application's traffic and real-world performance [^2].
- **Automatic Optimizations:** Includes code-splitting, prefetching, and image optimization by default [^2].

## Next Steps and Troubleshooting

- **Monitoring:** Use the Vercel Dashboard for logs, analytics, and speed insights to understand your application's performance and traffic [^2].
- **Debugging:** Check the build and runtime logs in the Vercel Dashboard if your deployment fails or your application isn't working as expected.
- **Custom Domains:** Once deployed, consider adding a custom domain to your project.
- **Environment Variables:** Double-check that all necessary environment variables are configured correctly in your Vercel project settings.
- **Rollbacks:** Vercel makes it easy to revert to a previous deployment if issues arise.
