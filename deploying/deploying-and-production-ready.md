### Learning Objectives
**Participants will be able to:**

- Understand the difference between setting up a local and production environment
- Understand the difference between production and deployment
- Build a production environment for their local project

## Build Your Production Instructions

These instructions will help you to have a production environment different from your local dev. This will help you to have a place to show your last working code while having a different space to keep working on improving your project. 

### Things to modify in your CLIENT folder

1. Add your local server as a proxy in the package. json file in the CLIENT side. This will help you to run all your files on one server and will tell that server which port to use when is doing any fetch call. You should see something like this:

1. This proxy will tell the server what port to use, so you NOW can safely delete all references to your localhost in your CLIENT React files.

1. Once you update all your fetch calls to localhost you can successfully create your build production package. Go to your terminal to the CLIENT folder and run the command npm run build. You will see a message like this: (this could take a while!)

1. Once that process is finished, if you do ls in your client folder you will see a build folder. That folder contains your production code.

1. Make sure that you include that build folder in your .gitignore. You donâ€™t want your production code on Github
