# Advanced Node.js Topics

## Estimated Time
**Total Time:** 4-5 hours
- **Reading:** 2 hours
- **Hands-on Activities:** 2.5-3 hours
- **Discussion & Code Review:** 30 minutes

## Prerequisites
Before tackling advanced Node.js concepts, ensure you're comfortable with:
- [Node.js Fundamentals](https://github.com/Techtonica/curriculum/blob/main/node-js/node-js.md) - Basic Node.js concepts and npm
- [Express.js Basics](https://github.com/Techtonica/curriculum/blob/main/express-js/express.md) - Creating basic web servers and routes
- [JavaScript Promises and Async/Await](https://github.com/Techtonica/curriculum/blob/main/javascript/javascript-9-async.md) - Asynchronous JavaScript patterns
- [Database Basics](https://github.com/Techtonica/curriculum/blob/main/databases/database-intro.md) - Understanding of database concepts

## Motivation
Moving from frontend development or another field into backend development can feel like learning a completely different language. Node.js isn't just JavaScript running on a server—it's a powerful platform for building scalable, real-time applications that serve millions of users.

Understanding advanced Node.js concepts will help you build production-ready applications, not just tutorial projects. These skills directly translate to job responsibilities: handling user authentication, managing database connections efficiently, building APIs that other developers will use, and ensuring your applications can handle real-world traffic. Companies need developers who can build robust backend systems, and these advanced concepts are what separate junior developers from those ready for mid-level and senior positions.

## Objectives
By the end of this topic outline, you will be able to:
- Build custom Express.js middleware for cross-cutting concerns
- Implement secure authentication and authorization systems
- Design and build RESTful APIs following industry best practices
- Handle errors gracefully and provide meaningful feedback to clients
- Optimize Node.js applications for performance and scalability
- Work with databases efficiently using connection pooling and query optimization
- Deploy Node.js applications with proper environment configuration
- Write comprehensive tests for backend applications
- Debug and profile Node.js applications to identify bottlenecks

## Specific Things to Learn

### Advanced Express.js Patterns
- **Custom Middleware:** Creating reusable middleware for logging, validation, and error handling
- **Error Handling:** Centralized error handling and custom error classes
- **Route Organization:** Structuring large applications with routers and controllers
- **Request Validation:** Input sanitization and validation using libraries like Joi
- **Response Formatting:** Consistent API response structures and status codes

### Authentication and Security
- **JWT Implementation:** Creating, signing, and verifying JSON Web Tokens
- **Password Security:** Hashing with bcrypt and salt rounds
- **Session Management:** Stateful vs stateless authentication approaches
- **Security Headers:** Using helmet.js and other security middleware
- **Rate Limiting:** Protecting APIs from abuse and DDoS attacks
- **CORS Configuration:** Managing cross-origin requests safely

### Database Integration and Optimization
- **Connection Pooling:** Managing database connections efficiently
- **Query Optimization:** Writing efficient database queries and using indexes
- **Transaction Management:** Ensuring data consistency with database transactions
- **ORM vs Query Builders:** When to use Sequelize, Mongoose, or raw queries
- **Database Migrations:** Managing schema changes in production environments

### Performance and Scalability
- **Caching Strategies:** Redis integration and in-memory caching
- **Asynchronous Patterns:** Streams, events, and worker threads
- **Memory Management:** Understanding garbage collection and memory leaks
- **Clustering:** Using the cluster module for multi-core utilization
- **Profiling and Monitoring:** Identifying performance bottlenecks

### API Design and Documentation
- **RESTful Principles:** Resource-based URLs and HTTP method usage
- **API Versioning:** Strategies for maintaining backward compatibility
- **Documentation:** Using tools like Swagger/OpenAPI for API documentation
- **Testing APIs:** Integration testing with supertest and Jest

## Activities

### Activity 1: Custom Middleware Workshop (45 minutes)
**Goal:** Build reusable middleware components for common application needs
Create a suite of custom middleware functions that you might use in a real application, understanding how middleware fits into the request-response cycle.

**Tasks:**
1. Build a request logging middleware that captures timing and user information
2. Create an authentication middleware that validates JWT tokens
3. Implement a rate limiting middleware to prevent API abuse
4. Design a validation middleware that works with different data schemas
5. Test your middleware with a sample Express application

### Activity 2: Secure Authentication System (60 minutes)
**Goal:** Implement a complete authentication flow with security best practices
Build a user authentication system that handles registration, login, password reset, and protected routes—skills you'll use in almost every web application.

**Tasks:**
1. Create user registration with password hashing
2. Implement login with JWT token generation
3. Build middleware to protect routes requiring authentication
4. Add password reset functionality with temporary tokens
5. Implement role-based access control for different user types
6. Test the entire authentication flow

### Activity 3: RESTful API Design Challenge (75 minutes)
**Goal:** Design and implement a complete REST API following industry standards
Create a blog API that demonstrates proper REST principles, error handling, and documentation—similar to what you might build in your first backend role.

**Tasks:**
1. Design resource endpoints for posts, comments, and users
2. Implement CRUD operations with proper HTTP status codes
3. Add input validation and error handling
4. Create API documentation using Swagger/OpenAPI
5. Write integration tests for all endpoints
6. Add pagination and filtering capabilities


### Activity 4: Performance Optimization Lab (50 minutes)
**Goal:** Identify and fix performance issues in a Node.js application
Work with a deliberately slow application to practice the debugging and optimization skills you'll need when applications grow and performance becomes critical.

**Tasks:**
1. Profile a slow Node.js application to identify bottlenecks
2. Implement caching to reduce database queries
3. Optimize database queries and add appropriate indexes
4. Add connection pooling for database connections
5. Implement response compression and static file optimization
6. Measure and compare performance before and after optimizations

### Activity 5: Production Deployment Simulation (40 minutes)
**Goal:** Prepare a Node.js application for production deployment
Learn the configuration and deployment practices that separate development projects from production-ready applications.

**Tasks:**
1. Configure environment variables for different deployment stages
2. Set up proper logging for production monitoring
3. Implement health check endpoints for load balancers
4. Configure security headers and HTTPS settings
5. Create a deployment checklist and documentation
6. Set up basic monitoring and alerting
