# How to Pair Program

### Week 1 Keywords and Questions

- Driver
- Navigator
- What is something you need to keep in mind when pair programming?

### Prerequisites

- [Asking Good Questions lesson](/asking-good-questions/asking-good-questions.md)
- [Interpersonal Conflict Resolution lesson](/career/conflict-resolution.md)
- [Professionalism lesson](/onboarding/professionalism.md)

### Motivation

Pair programming is a very common way to write code and solve software engineering problems. Pair programming generally produces higher-quality code, meaning fewer bugs and better readability.

### Pair Programming Across Varied Mastery Levels
As a new developer, you will have times when you will pair program with more experienced or specialized colleagues. This is an opportunity to rapidly accelerate your learning and grasp complex technical domains. This collaboration fosters immediate knowledge transfer, significantly enhances skill development, and improves code quality through real-time feedback. Ultimately, it strengthens team cohesion and cultivates a shared understanding of the codebase, leading to more effective problem-solving.

üë©üèΩ‚Äçüíª Session Management
- [ ] Set clear goals before starting
- [ ] Establish regular check-in points
- [ ] Document insights and decisions
- [ ] Define driver (writes) / navigator (guides) roles

üó£Ô∏è Communication Guidelines
- [ ] Encourage questioning without fear
- [ ] Maintain constructive dialogue
- [ ] Focus on understanding rather than solutions
- [ ] Define & document your agreed upon approach
- [ ] Both developers contribute actively to problem-solving

üçè Guided Learning Exchange with Open-Ended Questions
- [ ] Instead of saying "use filter()", ask:
  - "What array methods could we use here?"
  - "How would you handle empty arrays?"
  - "What edge cases should we consider?"

üß† Shared Problem Analysis
- [ ] Confirm understanding of the problem and state assumptions
- [ ] Understand core development considerations with questions:
  - "What are the key considerations for handling edge cases?"
  - "How would you test this function?"
  - "What performance implications should we consider?"
- [ ] Discuss tradeoffs and/or benefits of your intended solution
- [ ] Take a stab at understanding the complexity of the problem

ü§î Mutual Code Exploration Through Curiosity
- [ ] While navigating: "Why did you choose this array method?"
- [ ] During implementation: "How would you refactor this to improve readability?"
- [ ] When encountering issues: "What debugging strategies would you recommend?"

‚öôÔ∏è Implementation
- [ ] Write code together
- [ ] Test Assumptions
- [ ] Document reasoning

### Common Mistakes / Misconceptions

- **"I could be doing this so much faster on my own."** Sometimes, this is true. But a big drawback to coding on your own is that you're far less likely to catch bugs early on. And, since no one is checking your code, the readability of code you write alone may not be as good as the readability of code you write with someone else. So while you may be able to write code more quickly by yourself, the time it takes to work through bugs on your own usually negates this advantage.
- **"Real programmers do not program in pairs."** Some companies exclusively use pair programming ([Pivotal Labs](https://pivotal.io/labs) is one such example). Many companies use pair programming only at certain times or in certain situations. Some companies don't practice pair programming at all.
- **"I don't know what's going on or what my pair is doing, so I'm just going to sit back and watch them."** Pair programming is not pair programming when only one person is doing the work. Speak up and advocate for yourself. Ask questions and stay involved! If you need a break to reset your mind, ask for one.
